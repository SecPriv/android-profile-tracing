# README

This is an older version of the script. The current version is part of a bigger tool to explore app markets and not in the scope of the profiles paper. It should be enough to get started but might have a bug or two, the current tooling will be open source and the important bit is the apkeep patch in `/dependencies`, which we will hopefully land upstream and won't have to maintain as a fork.
