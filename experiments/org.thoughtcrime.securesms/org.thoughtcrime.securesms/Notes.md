Baseline has 55755 methods, a subset of those is in the cloud profile. (not always true, see study)

the explore notebook is not necessary, we can also use profman with included apk to dump full signatures of methods. oh well, SCIENCE!

We also tookk a brief look at tracing activities after the 30% paper used this as coverage metric. very obvious: the login screen hinders getting to the chat activity so that's a nice future work
